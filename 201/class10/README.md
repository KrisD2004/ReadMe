## Troubleshooting

There are 2  main types of errors you going to come across, syntax and logic errors.

* Syntax errors are spelling errors within your code.

* Logic errors are where syntax is actually correct but the code isnt what you intended it to be. This mean the program runs succesfully but gives incorrect results.

There are other common errors that youll come across in your code.

* SyntaxError: missing; before statment- This basically means you are missing a semicolon at the end of one of your codes.

* SyntaxError: missing parathesis after arguement list- This mostly means you are missing a closing parenthesis at the end of a function/method call.

* SyntaxError: missing : after property id- This error usually relates to an incorrectly formed JavaScript object, but in this case we managed to get it by changing

* Syntax: missing curly braces after function body: it generally means that you've missed one of your curly braces from a function or conditional structure

* Syntax Error: expected expression, got 'string' or SyntaxError: unterminated string literal-These errors generally mean that you've left off a string value's opening or closing quote mark.

# What are browser developer tools?

Every modern web browser includes a powerful suite of developer tools. These tools do a range of things, from inspecting currently-loaded HTML, CSS and JavaScript to showing which assets the page has requested and how long they took to load.

## Questions

1. Syntax Errors occur when we violate the rules of writing the statements of the programming language. Logical Errors occur due to our mistakes in programming logic.
2. I have encounterednsyntax errors dealing iwth missing parenthesis and curly braces. I just go back to the line theyre missing on and go back and add them.
3. a breakpoint is a means of acquiring knowledge about a program during its execution.

## things i want to know more about

I want to know more about using dev tools and how to use them. I want to learn more about how to resolve logic error issues.
