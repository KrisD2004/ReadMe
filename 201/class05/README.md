# Reading: Images, colro, text

## Images

The element tag <img> is used to embed a simple image in a webpage.

Img is a void element which means it cannot have any child content and cannot have an end tag.

## Alternative text

Alt is supposed to be a textual description of the image for use in situtations where the image cannot be seen or takes a long time to render because of slow internet connection.

Reasons you need to use alt text: User is visually impaired and is using a screen reader, Spelling of the file or path might be wrong, browser doesnt support the image type and some people still use text only browsers like linux which displays the alt text of images, wanting to provide text for search engines to utilize, and users have turned off images to reduce data transfer volume and distractions.
