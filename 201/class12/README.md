## Canavas Element

* The Canavas element in html allows you to draw 2D graphics usig Javascript.
* This element requires at least 2 attributes: width and height that specify the size of the canvas
* Like other elements, you can access the width and height properties of the canvas element via its DOM properties
* The canavas element unlike the img element, requires an closing tag.
* Any content between the opening and closing tags is fallback content that will display only if the browser doesn’t support the canvas element.

## Chart js

* Chart.js is very well suited for large datasets. 
* Chart.js renders chart elements on an HTML5 canvas unlike several other, mostly D3.js-based, charting libraries that render as SVG. Canvas rendering makes Chart.js very performant, especially for large datasets and complex visualizations that would otherwise require thousands of SVG nodes in the DOM tree.
* Chart.js provides a set of frequently used chart types, plugins, and customization options. In addition to a reasonable set of built-in chart types, you can use additional community-maintained chart types . On top of that, it’s possible to combine several chart types into a mixed chart (essentially, blending multiple chart types into one on the same canvas).
