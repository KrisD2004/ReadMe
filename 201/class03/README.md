Everything in CSS has a box around it it.
Learning to understand these boxes is the key to being able to create more complicated layouts with CSS or just to align items with other items.
Boxes have an inner display type and outer display type.

## Outer display type

If a box has an outer display type of block then: **The box will break onto a new line, The width and height properties are respected, padding margin and border will cause other elements to be pushed away from the box.**

If a box has an outer display type of inline, then: **The box will not break onto a new line.**
**The width and height properties will not apply.**
**Vertical padding, margins, and borders will apply but will not cause other inline boxes to move away from the box**
