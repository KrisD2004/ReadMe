# Forms and JS Events

## Elements

The form element usually defines a form and attributes that determine the forms behavior.

The fieldset element is an convenient way to make groups of widgets that all share the same purpose.

The (label) element is the formal way to define a label for an HTML form widget. This is the most important element if you want to build accessible forms — when implemented properly, screen readers will speak a form element's label along with any related instructions, as well as it being useful for sighted users.

## Web forms

Forms are  one of the main points of interaction between a suer and a website. These web forms allow the user to enter data.

A web form's HTML is made up of one or more form controls (sometimes called widgets), plus some additional elements to help structure the overall form — they are often referred to as HTML forms. The controls can be single or multi-line text fields, dropdown boxes, buttons, checkboxes, or radio buttons, and are mostly created using the input element.

# JavaScript Events

Events are things that happen in the system you are programming — the system produces (or "fires") a signal of some kind when an event occurs, and provides a mechanism by which an action can be automatically taken (that is, some code running) when the event occurs.

## QUESTIONS

1. The reason why forms are important is that Online Forms Are Trackable Online forms allow a website owner to keep track of the number of visitors to the site; when they visited, if they filled the online form or not, and the amount of time they spent on the site.
2. Be simple and straightforward If a form asks for too much information, you risk losing submissions and conversions. This is something to keep in ind when making online forms.
3. **Label Element**- is useful for screen-reader users, because the screen-reader will read out loud the label when the user focus on the input element.
**Test area**- element defines a multi-line input field (a text area):
**Button**- element defines a clickable button
**fieldset**-element is used to group related data in a form.
**legend**-element defines a caption for the fieldset element
