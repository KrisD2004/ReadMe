## HTML Text fundementals

One of the most inmportant jobs for html is to give text structure so that a browser can display an html document the way its developer intends.

Html can be used for structuring a page of text by adding different headings and paragraphs, emphaszing words, creating lists, and etc.

## How CSS is structed

You can apply CSS to a document using 3 methods.(3 methods: External stylesheet, with an internal stylesheet, and with inline styles)

**External Stylesheet** contains CSS in a separate file with a (.css) extension. This is the most common and useful method of bringing CSS to a document.

Internal stylesheet resides witin an HTML document. If you want to create a internal stylesheet, you place CSS inside a style element contained inside the html head.
EX.(<style>
      h1 {
        color: blue;
        background-color: yellow;
        border: 1px solid black;
      }

      p {
        color: red;
      }
    </style>)

Inline styles are CSS declarations that affect a single html element, contained within a style attribute.
Ex.(<p> style="color:red;">This is my first CSS example</p>)
