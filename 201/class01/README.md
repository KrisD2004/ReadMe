# Getting started with HTML

## intro to HTML

HTML which stands for Hypertext markup language is a markup language.
HTML tells the web browsers how to structure the web pages you visit.
The wbe developer can make it as simple or complicated.
HTML has a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of content to make it appear in a certain way. 
Enclosing tags can make content into a hyperlink to connect to another page, italicize words, and so on.
The tags in HTML aren't case sensitive.Ex.(title can be written like TITLE, TItLe, and TITle will they will all work.) Its better to write all tags in lowercase.

## Anatomy of an HTML element

**Opening Tag** consists of the name of the element wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This tag marks where the element begins to take effect.
**Content** is the content of the element. Its like the text of the element.
**Closing tag** Just like the opening tag but it includes a forward slash before the element name. This marks the end of the element.

## Document and Website structure

Webpages can look pretty different from one another, but they all tend to share similar standard components, unless the page is displaying a fullscreen video or game, is part of some kind of art project.
**Header** is usually the big strip across the top with a big heading, logo, and perhaps a tagline. Usually stays the same from one webpage to another.
**Navigation bar** Links to the sites main sections, represented by menu buttons, links, or tabs.
**Main content** the big area in the center that contains the most of the unique content of a given webpage, for example, the video you watch or the storie you reading or the map you viewing.
**Sidebar** Some peripheral info, links, ads, quotes and more.
**footer** the strip across the bottom of the page that mostly contains the fine print, copyright notices, or contact info. Its like a header...its a place to put common info but that info isnt critical to the wbesite itself.

## HTML tags to use to represent such sections(<>)

Header, Nav(nav bar), main(main content with various content subsections represented by article, section, and div) aside(sidebar), and footer.
