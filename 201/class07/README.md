## HTML table basics

A table in html is a structured set of data made up of rows and columns aka tabular data.
A table allows you to quickly and easily look up values that indicate some kind of connection between different types of data, for example a person and their age, or a day of the week, or the timetable for a local swimming pool.
The point of a table is that it is rigid. Information is easily interpreted by making visual associations between row and column headers.
Tables if implemented right can enhance the experience of sighted and visually impaired users alike.
