# HTML Links, JS Functions, and Intro to CSS Layout

## Creating Hyperlinks

Hyperlinks are important! They're what makes the web a *web*.

## What is Hyperlink

Hyperlinks allow users to link documents to other documents or resources, link to specific parts of documents, or make apps available at a web address.

Pretty much any web content can be turnedminto a link so when you click it the web browsers goes to another web address or URL.

## Anatomy of a link

A normal link is created by wrapping the text or other content inside an <a> element and using the href attribute, also known as hypertext reference or target.

## IMage links

If you have an image you want to make into a link, use the <a> element to wrap the image file referenced with the <img> element.

HTML Questions

1. in an anchor element or <a> tag
2. the href attribute is to specify the url of the page or external resource that link goes too.
3. We can use keywords to ensure our link pages are accesible to all users.

## Positioning

Potioning allows users to take elements out of normal document flows and make them act differently.
Positioning allows users to produce interesting results by overriding normal doc flows.

**Static Positioning** is the default that every element gets. This just means put the element intovits normal position in the document flow.

**Relative Positioning** is similar to static. The difference is that once the positioned element has taken its place in the normal flow you can modify its final position.

CSS Questions

1. Normal Flow, or Flow Layout, is the way that Block and Inline elements are displayed on a page before any changes are made to their layout
2. Inline elements occupy only enough width that is sufficient to it and allows other elements next to it which are inline. Block elements consume the entire width available irrespective of their sufficiency. They always start in a new line and have top and bottom margins.
3. Static positioning is the default for every html element
4. Some advantages that come with using absolute postioning is that its less depending on floats and margins
5. Fixed and absolute are different because absolute just stays while fixed moves around.

## FUnction parameters

Functions requires parameters to be specifed when you are invoking them- these are values that need to be included inside the function parentheses, which it needs to do its job properly.

## Optional parameters

SOme parameters are opitonal and you dont have to specify those. If you dont , the fucntion will adopt some kind of default behavior. 

JavaSScript Questions

1. Function declarations load before any code is executed.
Function expressions load only when the interpreter reaches that line of code.
2. Parameters and arguements are the same thing.

Micellaeous questions

1. Pair programming allows greater effieceny and engaed collaboration.
It provides greater effeiceny becuase its more than one person working on the code and its easier to catch mistakes when you have two people working on the same code.
Collaboration helps both people stay on track whenit comes to coding.
