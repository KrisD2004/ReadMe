# CSS Animations and Transforms

## CSS Transforms

* The transform property comes in two different settings, two-dimensional and three-dimensional. Each of these come with their own individual properties and values.
* 2D Transforms work on the x and y axes, known as horizontal and vertical axes. 
* Three-dimensional transforms work on both the x and y axes, as well as the z axis. These three-dimensional transforms help define not only the length and width of an element, but also the depth. 

## 2D rotate 

* The transform property accepts a handful of different values.
* The rotate value provides the ability to rotate an element from 0 to 360 degrees. 
* Using a positive value will rotate an element clockwise, and using a negative value will rotate the element counterclockwise.
* The default point of rotation is the center of the element, 50% 50%, both horizontally and vertically.

## 2D scale

* Using the scale value within the transform property allows you to change the appeared size of an element.

## 2d translate

* The translate value works a bit like that of relative positioning, pushing and pulling an element in different directions without interrupting the normal flow of the document.

## 2D skew 

* The last transform value in the group, skew, is used to distort elements on the horizontal axis, vertical axis, or both. The syntax is very similar to that of the scale and translate values. 


## Questions 

1. The transform CSS property lets you rotate, scale, skew, or translate an element
2. CSS transitions allows you to change property values smoothly, over a given duration.
3. CSS transitions are generally best for simple from-to movements, while CSS animations are for more complex series of movements.
4. The benefits are that it allows the appearance of images to catch the attention of users.
