# Diversity & Inclusion in the Tech Industry

## Why diversity matters to your tech company

* Diverse teams are smarter and more creative: Research in fields like organizational science, psychology, and education suggests that diverse teams bring different perspectives and problem-solving approaches, leading to faster and better solutions.

* Diverse companies perform better: Numerous studies have shown a positive correlation between diverse organizations and improved financial outcomes. For example, research indicates that female representation in top management is associated with an increase in firm value, and racial and gender diversity at executive and board levels are linked to better company performance.

* Companies are losing out on great talent: Failing to attract and hire employees from underrepresented backgrounds means missing out on valuable talent. Biased hiring practices can negatively impact how candidates from underrepresented backgrounds are evaluated, hindering the recruitment of diverse candidates.

* Diverse companies can better serve a diverse user base: When the employees of an organization reflect their users and desired users, they can develop products and services that cater to diverse needs. Failing to consider the perspectives of different groups can lead to oversights and limitations in product design and functionality.

* It's the right thing to do: Some leaders prioritize diversity and inclusion efforts because they believe it is morally right. They see the tech industry as an opportunity to address social inequality and ensure that diverse communities have a voice in shaping technology.

Understanding these rationales and identifying one that resonates with a tech company can be a crucial first step. However, it is important to go beyond mere recognition and develop a comprehensive strategy for building a diverse and inclusive company, accompanied by an accountability plan to ensure effectiveness.

### Questions on Diversity

1. What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?

During the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science, several significant events and trends occurred:
Rise of Personal Computers: In the 1980s, personal computers became more accessible and affordable, leading to their widespread adoption in households. However, marketing and advertising often targeted boys and men, associating computers with gaming and technical hobbies, which contributed to the perception that computing was a male-dominated field.
Gender Stereotypes: Society's prevailing gender stereotypes and biases portrayed computing and programming as more suitable for men. This perception was reinforced through media representation and societal expectations that often discouraged girls from pursuing technical interests or careers.
Educational Shifts: As computers became more prevalent, schools started introducing computer science courses. However, many of these courses were often offered in predominantly male environments or were seen as more suitable for boys. Lack of encouragement and support for girls in these settings further discouraged their participation.
Cultural and Social Factors: The tech industry and computing culture developed predominantly within male-dominated spaces. The early hacker and computer enthusiast communities were mostly male, which created an environment that might have felt unwelcoming or exclusionary to women.

2. Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?

The fact that males had been playing on computers growing up matters because it contributed to the gender gap in computer science. When boys had early exposure to computers and technology, they had more opportunities to develop technical skills, gain familiarity with programming languages, and build confidence in using computers. This early advantage gave them a head start when it came to pursuing computer science education and careers. On the other hand, girls who lacked similar exposure or encouragement may have felt less confident or capable in pursuing computer science.

## When Women Stopped Coding

* In the early days of computer programming, many of the pioneers were women, and the number of women studying computer science was growing faster than men.
* In 1984, there was a significant decline in the percentage of women in computer science, while the share of women in other technical and professional fields continued to rise.
* The decline coincided with the rise of personal computers in U.S. homes, which were primarily marketed to men and boys. Computers were seen as toys and were associated with male interests.
* The narrative that computers were for boys became ingrained in the culture, defining who geeks were and creating a techie culture.
* Researcher Jane Margolis found that families were more likely to buy computers for boys, even if girls showed interest in computers.
* As personal computers became more common, computer science professors began assuming that students had grown up playing with computers at home, creating a gap for students, particularly women, who didn't have access to computers.
* The assumption that students had prior computer experience disadvantaged women who were starting from a lower level of familiarity.
* The lack of early exposure and experience with computers led to feelings of being behind and discouraged some women from pursuing computer science.
However, some women, like Patricia Ordóñez, eventually returned to computer science and succeeded after finding mentors and overcoming initial setbacks.

### Queestion

1. When are diversity efforts most successful?

Diversity efforts are most successful when they are driven by a genuine commitment from company leaders. Meaningful commitment involves understanding why diversity matters and actively working towards creating an inclusive environment.

2. Why do diverse companies perform better?

Diverse companies tend to perform better for several reasons:

Broader Perspectives and Creativity: Diversity brings together individuals with different backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. This diversity of thought and approach fosters innovation, creativity, and problem-solving, leading to better outcomes.

Enhanced Decision-Making: Diverse teams have access to a wider range of information and perspectives, which can lead to more informed and well-rounded decision-making. Diverse viewpoints help to challenge assumptions, identify blind spots, and consider a broader range of possibilities.

Better Understanding of Customers and Markets: Diverse companies are often better equipped to understand and serve diverse customer bases. When the employees of a company reflect their users and desired users, they can better anticipate and address their needs, preferences, and challenges.

3. An example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base is the development of inclusive technology products. For instance, when a tech company has a diverse team of designers, engineers, and product managers, they are more likely to consider a wide range of user experiences and needs.
