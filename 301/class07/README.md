# NODE.JS

## What Is Node and When Should I Use It?

* Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine that allows you to build scalable network applications with JavaScript on the server-side.
* Node.js is event-driven, meaning that it operates on an event loop and can handle multiple requests without blocking.
* Node.js has a module system, allowing you to easily include external modules and packages.
* The Node Package Manager (npm) is a powerful tool that allows you to easily manage and install packages and dependencies for your Node.js project.
* Node.js is often used for building web applications, APIs, and real-time services, as well as for performing tasks such as file handling, networking, and data streaming.
* Node.js is designed to be fast, efficient, and lightweight, making it a popular choice for developers who want to build high-performance applications.
* Some popular frameworks and libraries for building web applications with Node.js include Express, Koa, and Hapi.
* Node.js also has support for working with databases, including MongoDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL, among others.
* Node.js supports both synchronous and asynchronous programming paradigms, allowing you to choose the approach that best fits your needs.
* Node.js is a powerful tool that can be used to build a wide range of applications and services, making it a valuable skill for developers to have.

### Questions for Node Notes

1. Node.js is a server-side JavaScript runtime built on top of Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It enables developers to write server-side applications using JavaScript and allows for asynchronous, event-driven programming.
2. Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine is a high-performance JavaScript engine that compiles and executes JavaScript code. It is used by the Google Chrome browser and Node.js to provide fast and efficient execution of JavaScript code.
3. Node.js being a JavaScript runtime means that it allows you to run JavaScript code on the server-side instead of just on the client-side in the browser. It provides an environment for executing JavaScript code outside of a web browser, enabling developers to build web servers, command-line tools, and other applications with JavaScript.
4. npm is the Node Package Manager, a tool for managing packages and dependencies for Node.js projects. It is used to install and manage packages, as well as to manage dependencies between packages.
5. v10.19.0
6. 6.14.4
7. To install the 'jshint' library/package, you would use the following command in the terminal/command prompt: npm install jshint.
8. Node.js is used for building server-side applications, command-line tools, and other applications that require server-side functionality. It is often used for building web applications, real-time services, APIs, and for performing tasks such as file handling, networking, and data streaming.

## Pair Programming

The benefits of pair programming, which is a practice in software development where two programmers work together on the same codebase, typically sharing a single workstation.

Here are some reasons :

* Improved Code Quality: Pair programming can lead to improved code quality because it encourages programmers to write cleaner code, catch errors more quickly, and maintain high coding standards.

* Faster Problem Solving: Two programmers working together can solve problems more quickly than one working alone. They can bounce ideas off each other, share knowledge, and collaborate on solutions.

* Learning Opportunities: Pair programming provides an opportunity for both programmers to learn from each other. It allows for the sharing of knowledge, skills, and expertise.

* Reduced Onboarding Time: New programmers can be onboarded more quickly through pair programming because they can learn from a more experienced programmer.

* Better Communication: Pair programming requires clear communication and encourages open dialogue between the two programmers. This can lead to better collaboration, fewer misunderstandings, and better team dynamics.

* More Enjoyable Work: Pair programming can be more enjoyable than working alone because it provides social interaction and the opportunity to work together towards a common goal.

Overall, the article highlights the benefits of pair programming for both the individual programmers and the team as a whole. It emphasizes the importance of collaboration, communication, and learning in software development.

### Questions Pair Programming

1. * Improved code quality

* Faster problem solving

* Learning opportunities

* Reduced onboarding time

* Better communication

* More enjoyable work
These are 6 reasons why pair programming is good.

2. Faster problem solving has been very helpful when pair programming. Sometimes you might not even know what problem is occuring but a partner might and like wise like when me and some classmates were doing group projects.

3. Pair programming is a practice in which two programmers work together on the same codebase, typically sharing a single workstation. One programmer is the "driver", who is responsible for typing out the code and implementing the ideas, while the other programmer is the "navigator", who is responsible for reviewing the code and suggesting improvements. The roles can be switched periodically to ensure that both programmers have the opportunity to participate in both driving and navigating. Pair programming requires clear communication and open dialogue between the two programmers to ensure that they are working effectively and efficiently towards a common goal.
