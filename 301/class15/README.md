# Class 15 Notes

## Auth0

* Auth0 supports various flows for different types of applications, including server-side, mobile, desktop, client-side, machine-to-machine, and device applications.

* The recommended flow for regular web apps is the Authorization Code Flow. It involves exchanging an Authorization Code for a token.

* Mobile and native applications can also use the Authorization Code Flow but with an additional security measure called Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE).

* The Implicit Flow is an alternative to the Authorization Code Flow, intended for Public Clients. It can be used when the application only requires an ID token for user authentication.

* Single-Page Applications (SPAs) can authenticate using cookies, which can be achieved with the Implicit Flow with Form Post.

* The Hybrid Flow combines features of the Authorization Code Flow and Implicit Flow, allowing immediate access to an ID token while securely retrieving access and refresh tokens.

* The Client Credentials Flow is suitable for machine-to-machine (M2M) applications that authenticate and authorize the app itself, rather than a user.

* The Device Authorization Flow is used for input-constrained devices that rely on user authorization through a separate computer or smartphone.

* The Resource Owner Password Flow should be used sparingly and only for highly-trusted applications, as it involves collecting and submitting user credentials directly.

These are the various flows supported by Auth0 for different application scenarios. Each flow has its own purpose and recommended use cases. It's important to choose the appropriate flow based on the specific requirements and security considerations of your application.

### Question AUth0

1. OAuth (Open Authorization) is an open standard protocol that allows users to grant third-party applications limited access to their protected resources on a server, without sharing their credentials (username and password) directly with the application.

2. OAuth is an authorization framework that allows a third-party application to access a user's data on another service, without the need for the user to share their credentials directly. Here's a summary of the OAuth process using the example you provided:
The user wants to authorize PhotoShare to access their Facebook photos.
PhotoShare redirects the user to Facebook's authorization endpoint.
The user logs in to Facebook and grants PhotoShare permission to access their photos.
Facebook generates an authorization code and redirects the user back to PhotoShare's callback URL.
PhotoShare receives the authorization code.
PhotoShare sends a request to Facebook's token endpoint, including the authorization code, client ID, client secret, and callback URL.
Facebook verifies the code and responds with an access token and a refresh token.
PhotoShare can now use the access token to make requests to the Facebook API on behalf of the user.
The access token has an expiration time, but PhotoShare can use the refresh token to obtain a new access token when needed.
This process continues until the user revokes PhotoShare's access or the access token expires.
In summary, OAuth enables PhotoShare to obtain permission from the user to access their Facebook photos, and it provides a secure and standardized way for PhotoShare to authenticate and interact with the Facebook API on behalf of the user.

3. OpenID is an authentication protocol that is built on top of OAuth. It allows users to authenticate with an identity provider (IdP) and obtain an ID token, which contains information about the user. OpenID Connect (OIDC) is a specific implementation of OpenID that utilizes OAuth 2.0 for authentication and provides additional features like user information retrieval and session management.


## WHat is Auth0 and framework

OAuth is an open-standard authorization protocol or framework that allows unrelated servers and services to grant authenticated access to their resources without sharing the original logon credential. It provides a secure way for users to delegate limited access to their assets to third-party applications.

The OAuth process involves the following steps:

The user initiates an action on a client application that requires access to a resource on a different server.
The client application redirects the user to the server hosting the resource, commonly known as the service provider.
The user is prompted to authenticate themselves on the service provider's website.
Once authenticated, the service provider asks the user to authorize the client application's request for access to the requested resource.
If the user grants permission, the service provider generates an access token.
The access token is provided to the client application.
The client application uses the access token to access the user's resources on the service provider.
The service provider validates the access token and responds with the requested resource or performs the authorized action.
The client application can continue to access the user's resources until the access token expires or is revoked.
It's important to note that OAuth is not without vulnerabilities. For example, if a user is directed to a rogue website during the authentication process, their credentials could be compromised. To mitigate such risks, it's crucial for users to ensure they are entering their credentials on the legitimate service provider's domain and exercise caution when granting authorization to client applications.

OpenID, on the other hand, is an authentication protocol built on top of OAuth. It allows users to authenticate themselves with an identity provider (IdP) and obtain an ID token containing information about the user. OpenID Connect (OIDC) is a specific implementation of OpenID that combines OAuth 2.0 for authorization and provides additional features like user information retrieval and session management.

### AUthorization Questions 

1. Difference between Authorization and Authentication:
Authentication: Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or entity. It confirms whether the user is who they claim to be. Authentication typically involves the user providing credentials such as a username and password, which are then validated by the system.
Authorization: Authorization is the process of granting or denying access to specific resources or actions based on the authenticated user's permissions. Once a user is authenticated, authorization determines what they are allowed to do or access within the system.
2. Authorization Code Flow:
The Authorization Code Flow is an OAuth 2.0 flow designed for web applications and confidential clients (clients capable of securely storing client credentials). It is considered the most secure flow for server-side applications.
The flow involves multiple steps:
The client application redirects the user to the authorization server, including the desired scope and a redirect URI.
The user authenticates with the authorization server and provides consent to the requested permissions.
The authorization server generates an authorization code and redirects the user back to the client's redirect URI.
The client exchanges the authorization code for an access token by making a direct request to the authorization server, including the code, client credentials, and redirect URI.
The authorization server validates the code and returns an access token to the client.
The client can use the access token to make authorized requests to protected resources on behalf of the user.
3. Authorization Code Flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE):
PKCE is an extension of the Authorization Code Flow designed to enhance security for mobile and native applications that cannot securely store client credentials.
It mitigates the risk of interception of the authorization code by adding an additional step.
The flow is similar to the Authorization Code Flow, but the client first generates a cryptographic code verifier and a transformed code challenge.
When exchanging the authorization code for an access token, the client provides the original code verifier to prove possession of the code challenge.
4. Implicit Flow with Form Post:
The Implicit Flow with Form Post is an OAuth 2.0 flow primarily designed for single-page applications (SPAs) that run in a web browser.
In this flow, the access token is obtained directly from the authorization endpoint, without an intermediate authorization code exchange step.
After the user authenticates and grants permission, the authorization server redirects back to the client's redirect URI, including the access token in the URL fragment.
The client retrieves the access token from the fragment using JavaScript and can then make authorized API requests.
5. Client Credentials Flow:
The Client Credentials Flow is an OAuth 2.0 flow used by confidential clients (clients capable of securely storing client credentials) to obtain an access token.
In this flow, the client directly exchanges its own credentials (client ID and client secret) for an access token.
This flow is typically used when the client needs to access resources on its own behalf, rather than on behalf of a specific user.
6. Device Authorization Flow:
The Device Authorization Flow, also known as Device Flow, is an OAuth 2.0 flow designed for devices with limited input capabilities (such as smart TVs or game consoles) that cannot directly authenticate users.
In this flow, the device displays a user code and instructs the user to visit an authorization URL on another device.
The user enters the user code on the second device and authenticates with the authorization server.
Once authenticated, the second device receives an access token that can be used by the original device to make authorized requests.
7. Resource Owner Password Flow:
The Resource Owner Password Flow, also known as the Password Grant Type, is an OAuth 2.0 flow where
