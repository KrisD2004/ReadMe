## Markdowns paragraphs are like this(look at line 9-11)

Ex.I really like using Markdown.

I think I'll use it to format all of my documents from now on.

To create paragraphs, use a blank line to separate one or more lines of text.

If a paragraph isnt in a list then dont indent paragraphs with spaces or tabs(EX 15-18 you do)

Don't put tabs or spaces in front of your paragraphs.

Keep lines left-aligned like this.

(Lines 21-24 you dont do this)
   This can result in unexpected formatting problems.

  Don't add tabs or spaces in front of paragraphs.
  
## MARKDOWN HEADINGS

Markdown applications don’t agree on how to handle a missing space between the number signs (#) and the heading name. For compatibility, always put a space between the number signs and the heading name.
EXAMPLE:
(#Here is my heading) is wrong
(# Here is my heading) is the right way

You should also put blank lines before and after a heading for compatibility.
EXAMPLE:
Try to put a blank line before...

## Heading

...and after a heading.

DOING BOLD TEXT
To bold text, add two asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase. To bold the middle of a word for emphasis, add two asterisks without spaces around the letters.
EXAMPLE: 3 different ways
I really love **bold texting**
i love **chicken**
love**is**bold

## Basic Syntax

CommonMark and a few other lightweight markup languages let you use a parenthesis ()) as a delimiter (e.g., 1) First item), but not all Markdown applications support this, so it isn’t a great option from a compatibility perspective. For compatibility, use periods only.

Unordered Lists
To create an unordered list, add dashes (-), asterisks (*), or plus signs (+) in front of line items. Indent one or more items to create a nested list.
Unordered List Best Practices
Markdown applications don’t agree on how to handle different delimiters in the same list. For compatibility, don’t mix and match delimiters in the same list — pick one and stick with it.
To add another element in a list while preserving the continuity of the list, indent the element four spaces or one tab, as shown in the following examples.
