You always declare javascript variables with var, let, and/or const
The var keyword has been used in all Javascript code from 1995 up to 2015
The let and const keywords were added to Javascript in 2015.

## When to use const

ALways declare variables with **const** if you want a general rule.
Example of const
const price1 = 5
const price 2= 6
let total = price1 + price2

## JavaScript identifiers

Every javascript variable must be identified with unique names or identifiers.
Identifiers can be short names like x or y or something more descriptive like age, sum, totalVloume.
There are rules for making names for variables.
The names have to contain letters,digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
Names have to start with a letter
Names can also begin with $ and _
Names are case sensitive. (y and Y are different variables)
Reserved words like javascript cannot be used as names.
