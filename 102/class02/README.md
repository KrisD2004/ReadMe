# The Coders computer

## Test editor

is a piece of software that you download and install on
your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that
allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write
to build a web site. The text editor has to be one of the most
important tools you can use as an aspiring web developer

CHOOSING AN EDITOR
Most important features are code completion, syntax highlighting, lots of themes to prevent eye strain and the ability to choose from a healthy selection of
extensions available when you need them

Code completion allows you to start typing, and the code completion
feature will display possible suggestions based on what you originally
typed. This saves you time by providing a choice, rather than allowing
you to finish typing and possibly encounter typos

The next feature that you should look for in a text editor is a nice
series of themes. These themes will allow you to change the color of
the background of your text editor, the series of colors in your text,
and sometimes themes will affect other aspects of your text editing
software as well. Usually, web developers use a dark background and
brightly colored text. Dark theme is easier on the eyes.

## THINGS I WANT TO KNOW MORE ABPUT

DO all text editors have mostly the same qualities?
Are all text editiors able manage all coding languages?
Do lighter themes for editiors make a difference?
