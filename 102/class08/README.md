# Operators and Loops

There are many types of operators for example: Asignment, comparison,arithmetic, bitwise, logical, bigint, string, conditional, comma,unaray, relational.

## Assignment operators

This operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. Example of assignment operator is x=f()

## Comparison operators

A comparison operator compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true. Operands can be numerical, string, logical, or object values. 

## Arithmetic operators

An arithmetic operator takes numerical values (either literals or variables) as their operands and returns a single numerical value. 
Standard operators are +,-,multiplication, and division. 

## bitwise operators

A bitwise operator treats their operands as a set of 32 bits (zeros and ones), rather than as decimal, hexadecimal, or octal numbers.
An example of this is the decimal number nine has a binary representation of 1001.

## Logical operators

These operators are usually used with Boolean(logical) values; when they are, they return a boolean value. 

## bigint operators

Most operators that can be used between numbers can be used between BigInt values as well.

## String operators

Adding more to the comparison operators, which can be used on string values, the concatenation operator (+) concatenates two string values together, returning another string that is the union of the two operand strings.

## Ternary or Conditional

Ternary is the only Javascript operator that takes three operands.
The operator can have one of two values based on a condition

## Comma operators

This operator is mainly used inside a **for** loop and that allows multiple variables to be updated each time through the loop.The comma operator (,) evaluates both of its operands and returns the value of the last operand. 

## unary operators

A unary operation is an operation with only one operand.

Do most of these operators transfer over to other languages?
