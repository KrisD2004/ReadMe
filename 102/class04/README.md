## HTML Basics

HTML stands for Hypertext markup language.
HTML is the code you use to build a website and all of its contents.
HTML consists of a series of elements that you use to wrap different parts of the content to help it appear a certain way.

## Parts of HTML Elements

You have the **Opening tag**. This states where the element starys to take effect or where a paragraph begins.
You have the **Closing tag**. Its the same as the opening tag but it includes a *foward slash*. This shows where the element ends or wehre the paragraph ends.
You have the **content**. This is just the text or paragraph.
Lastly you have the **Element**. The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.

## Anatomy of an HTML DOC

These are elements that are combined to form an entire HTML page.

Doctype is the required preamble. Doctypes are meant to act as links to a set of rules that an HTML page has to follow.

The HTML. element is used to wrap all content on the page and is often reffered as the root element.

The head. this element acts as a container for everything you want to invlude on a HTML page that isnt the content you want to show your viewers

The title. This element sets the title of your website. It appears in the browser tab the website is loaded in.

The body. this contains all the cotent that you want to show the people when they visit your website.

The viewportt element ensures the page renders at the width of viewport preventing mobile browsers from opening pages wider than the viewport.
