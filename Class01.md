## We learned about headings from [Markdown Guide] (https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)

paragraphs are created like this
Lines breaks are done.

Markdowns paragraphs are like this(look at line 9-11)
Ex.I really like using Markdown.

I think I'll use it to format all of my documents from now on.

To create paragraphs, use a blank line to separate one or more lines of text.

If a paragraph isnt in a list then dont indent paragraphs with spaces or tabs(EX 15-18 you do)

Don't put tabs or spaces in front of your paragraphs.

Keep lines left-aligned like this.

(Lines 21-24 you dont do this)
   This can result in unexpected formatting problems.

  Don't add tabs or spaces in front of paragraphs.
  
MARKDOWN HEADINGS
Markdown applications donâ€™t agree on how to handle a missing space between the number signs (#) and the heading name. For compatibility, always put a space between the number signs and the heading name.
EXAMPLE: 
(#Here is my heading) is wrong
(# Here is my heading) is the right way

You should also put blank lines before and after a heading for compatibility.
EXAMPLE:
Try to put a blank line before...

# Heading

...and after a heading.

DOING BOLD TEXT
To bold text, add two asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase. To bold the middle of a word for emphasis, add two asterisks without spaces around the letters.
EXAMPLE: 3 different ways
I really love **bold texting**
i love __chicken__
love**is**bold
