# Testing and Swagger and Deployment

## Swagger 

This article provides an overview of Swagger (OpenAPI) and its usage in ASP.NET Core to describe and document REST APIs. Swagger allows you to define the capabilities of your API in a machine-readable format and generates interactive documentation to help both computers and humans understand the API's functionalities. Here are the key points covered in the article:

### OpenAPI vs. Swagger:

Swagger was donated to the OpenAPI Initiative in 2015, and since then, "Swagger" and "OpenAPI" are often used interchangeably.
OpenAPI refers to the specification itself.
Swagger encompasses tooling that works with the OpenAPI Specification, such as SwaggerUI and OpenAPIGenerator.

### OpenAPI Specification (openapi.json):

The OpenAPI specification is a document describing the capabilities of your API.
It's based on XML and attribute annotations in controllers and models.
It's used by tooling like SwaggerUI.
The specification includes details about paths, operations (such as GET, POST), responses, data types (schemas), and more.

### Swagger UI:

Swagger UI is a web-based user interface that visualizes the OpenAPI specification.
Both Swashbuckle and NSwag include an embedded version of Swagger UI.
The UI allows you to interactively test each public action method in your controllers.
You can expand sections, input parameters, and test API endpoints directly from the UI.

### Next Steps:

Get started with Swashbuckle to integrate Swagger UI into your ASP.NET Core app.
Get started with NSwag for a similar purpose.
The article emphasizes that Swagger (OpenAPI) provides a powerful way to document and test your APIs, making it easier to connect services and reduce the time needed for accurate documentation.

## Unit testing 


This article explains how to create unit tests for controller actions in ASP.NET MVC applications. The tutorial is written by Stephen Walther and covers different aspects of testing, including testing the view returned by a controller, testing the view data returned by a controller, and testing the action result returned by a controller. Here's a summary of the key points covered in the article:

1. Creating the Controller under Test:

The tutorial starts by creating a sample controller named ProductController with two action methods: Index and Details.
The Details action returns a view named "Details" and accepts an Id parameter.

2. Testing the View returned by a Controller:

This section focuses on testing whether a specific view is returned by a controller action.
A test class named ProductControllerTest is created with a test method named TestDetailsView.
The method creates an instance of ProductController, invokes the Details action, and asserts that the view name returned is "Details".

3. Testing the View Data returned by a Controller:

This part covers testing whether the correct data is passed to the view using ViewData.
The Details action is modified to pass a Product instance to the view.
The TestDetailsViewData method in the ProductControllerTest class verifies that the correct data (product name) is present in the ViewData model.

4. Testing the Action Result returned by a Controller:

This section demonstrates how to test different types of action results returned by a controller.
The Details action is updated to conditionally return a ViewResult or a RedirectToRouteResult based on the Id parameter.
The TestDetailsRedirect method in the ProductControllerTest class tests if the action correctly redirects to the "Index" action when a specific condition is met.


The tutorial provides insights into writing unit tests for various aspects of controller actions, including verifying views, view data, and different types of action results. Each section includes code samples and explanations to help you understand the testing process.

## Unit test controller logic in ASP.NET Core

It seems like you've provided a detailed article on unit testing controller logic in ASP.NET Core, along with code examples and explanations. This article covers various aspects of unit testing, including testing different scenarios for controller actions, setting up mock repositories, handling ModelState validation, and using ActionResult<T> for API methods.

If you're looking for a summary or key takeaways from this article, here are some important points:

* Unit Testing Controllers: Controllers play a crucial role in ASP.NET Core MVC apps, and it's important to ensure their behavior is as intended. Automated unit tests help detect errors before deploying the app to production.

* Unit Testing Focus: Unit tests for controllers should focus on testing the behavior of individual actions in isolation from their dependencies and infrastructure. Integration tests cover interactions among components.

* Mocking Dependencies: In unit tests, dependencies like repositories can be mocked using frameworks like Moq. Mocked objects allow you to define predetermined behaviors for testing.

* Sample HomeController: The article provides an example of a HomeController with methods for displaying brainstorming sessions and creating new sessions. Unit tests are demonstrated for the Index and Index (POST) actions.

* Testing HTTP GET Index Method: The article includes a unit test for the Index action of HomeController. The test mocks the repository's ListAsync method and verifies the ViewResult and model data.

* Testing HTTP POST Index Method: The article demonstrates unit tests for the POST version of the Index action. It covers scenarios for both invalid and valid ModelState. The tests use BadRequestObjectResult and RedirectToActionResult assertions.

* SessionController and IdeasController: The article also introduces unit tests for the SessionController and IdeasController, covering scenarios like invalid session IDs, session not found, and creating new ideas.

* ActionResult <T>: In ASP.NET Core 2.1 and later, ActionResult<T> allows returning specific types derived from ActionResult. The article showcases tests for ForSessionActionResult and CreateActionResult methods, which return different types of results based on conditions.

* Best Practices: The article emphasizes best practices, such as not testing model validation or binding in unit tests, and avoiding direct exposure of domain entities in API responses.

* Additional Resources: The article provides links to resources for integration tests in ASP.NET Core, creating and running unit tests with Visual Studio, and testing libraries like MyTested.AspNetCore.Mvc and JustMockLite.

Overall, this article serves as a comprehensive guide to unit testing controller logic in ASP.NET Core, highlighting the importance of testing individual actions, handling different scenarios, and making use of mock objects and ActionResult<T> for effective testing.
